# Examples Readme


## Utility files

__allows_imports_from_root.py - This file is used to allow imports from the parent directory, i.e., as if the file was placed in the main folder. Import this module at the top of every example file

example_runner.py - This file is used to run the examples and takes care of the imports.

## LUNATIC_AI_ROOT

The LUNATIC_AI_ROOT environment variable should be set to the root of the project. This is used to allow imports from the parent directory, i.e., as if the file was placed in the main folder.
Without the variable the script tries to infer to root by using its parent folder, which might NOT be the root folder of the project.  
To be on the save side, set the variable.
