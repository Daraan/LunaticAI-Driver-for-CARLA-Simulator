# PID controller using the following semantics:
#         K_P -- Proportional term
#         K_D -- Differential term
#         K_I -- Integral term
#         dt -- time differential in seconds
# offset: If different than zero, the vehicle will drive displaced from the center line.
# Positive values imply a right offset while negative ones mean a left one. 
# Numbers high enough to cause the vehicle to drive through other lanes might break the controller.
#  
# Notes:
# `sampling_resolution` is used by the global planner to build a graph of road segments, also to get a path of waypoints from A to B
#  
# `sampling_radius` is similar but only used only by the local_planner to compute the next waypoints forward. The distance of those is the sampling_radius.

# time differential in seconds
#  
# NOTE: Should set from main script.
